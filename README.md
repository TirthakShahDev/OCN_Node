## Open Charging Network

To participate in the OCN, a node must be used to broker OCPI requests (e.g. start/stop requests, POI data retrieval) 
between parties. There are two ways to use a node. Either it is run on-premises by an administrator, or it is provided 
as a Service by an OCN Node Provider. If the latter scenario is desired, an OCPI party (i.e. eMobility Service Provider
or Charge Point Operator) needs only to obtain a `CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_A` and versions endpoint from said provider to 
begin the regular OCPI 2.2 credentials registration process with the provider's OCN Node.  

For more information about the OCN, check out the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-node/wiki/).

## API Documentation

See [Open Charging Network Node API Documentation](https://shareandcharge.bitbucket.io).

## Dependencies

The OCN Node is built with Kotlin, targeting the JVM. [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html) or higher 
is needed to build and run the project. Additionally, the node can be run in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 
with the provided Dockerfile, however the build step takes place on the host rather than inside a container.
 

## Running a Local Open Charging Network

Before running a node and connecting it to a local, test or prod environment, it is recommended to become acquainted 
with how the network operates first. The `docker-compose` file provided spins up a local environment with the OCN
Registry and two OCN Nodes pre-configured. A [tutorial](./examples) has been provided to guide administrators and users 
of an OCN Node alike through various use case examples.  To complete this tutorial it is necessary to install
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) in addition to the above dependencies.

## Running a Node

First of all, clone the repository:

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:shareandcharge/ocn-node.git
cd ocn-node
```

### 1. Modifying Node Configuration

Firstly, it is important to configure the application properties for the desired environment or profile, e.g. `local`:

```
cd src/main/resources
cp application.dev.properties application.local.properties
vi application.local.properties
```

#### 1.1. Setting the Node Address

The field `ocn.node.url` describes the node's server address. If running a local network for development purposes,
setting the following:

```
ocn.node.url = http://localhost:8080
``` 

Results in requesting platforms obtaining OCPI module endpoints starting with `http://localhost:8080`, for 
example `http://localhost:8080/ocpi/2.2/sender/locations` for the locations module's sender interface.
 
Likewise, for a public node on the test network, the url would be `https://server.example.com`. This would translate
to `https://server.example.com/ocpi/2.2/sender/locations`. Be sure to include the protocol so that connected platforms
can correctly parse the endpoints provided.

On startup, the OCN client will ensure that the public URL set is reachable. Additionally, there is different
behaviour within this check depending on which mode the client is running in. See section 1.5 for more details.

#### 1.2. Connecting to a Database

The `dev` properties connects the node to an in-memory database, which will not persist data across node restarts.
If running the node in a test or production environment with Postgres installed, copy from the `psql` properties file 
instead:

```
cp application.psql.properties application.local.properties
```

The node may also be connected to a different database. This requires installing the relevant database driver as 
an `ocn-node` dependency via gradle and modifying application properties accordingly, in addition to running the 
database server itself. 

#### 1.3. Configuring the Network

The network on which any OCN Node is running on depends purely on the OCN Registry smart contract it is connected to.
These configuration properties belong to `ocn.node.web3`. Currently the `develop` branch is pre-configured (using the
provided `dev` and `psql` profiles) to use to the Energy Web Foundation's Volta test network, by connecting to a [remote Volta node](https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/703201459/Volta+Connecting+to+Remote+RPC) 
and the OCN Registry smart contract deployed on Volta with address `0x0A5f27Ee1EbDC68034aDbd9446F9375783aeF7DC`. Note
that subsequent commits may change this address as development of the OCN Registry takes place.

#### 1.4. Setting the Admin API key [optional]

The Admin API allows, for example, generating new OCPI tokens (`CREDENTIALS_TOKEN_A`) for planned platforms. An API
key can be set in the application's properties, else a new one will be generated on restart:

```
ocn.node.apikey = randomkey
```

The API key will be printed on node start, be it generated or user-specified. Consult the [API documentation](https://shareandcharge.bitbucket.io)
for more information on how to use the Admin API. 

#### 1.5 Setting the runtime mode

The client can be run in "dev" or "prod" mode. By default, prod mode is in effect, which will check to see if the
provided public client URL is reachable over HTTPS and is accessible to the outside world. When running in dev mode 
(by setting `ocn.client.dev = true`), the client will allow insecure HTTP connections made over localhost.

#### 1.6 Enabling message signing

A feature of the Open Charging Network is it's security. To ensure that requests sent over the OCN are delivered to 
their recipient as intended, messages are signed by the sender. In some particular cases, an OCN Node may need to 
rewrite entries in the sender's original requests (such as when providing response URLs in commands requests). The 
message signing functionality allows for this, as a signature of a modified request must also reference any values
that have been changed. For more details on how to sign and verify messages, check out the [OCN Notary](https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-notary).

During the alpha phase, message signing will not be enabled by default. **Once the OCN is in production, message signing
will be enabled by default.** To toggle this feature on/off, set `ocn.node.signatures` to true (on) or false (off). 

Be aware that even if an OCN Node does not require message signing, a recipient may still reject the request if it's
missing an `OCN-Signature` header. Additionally, the OCN Node will verify signatures if they are present in a request's
header, regardless of this setting. 

### 2. Running the Node

There are multiple ways to run an OCN Node. First of all, return to the root of the repository:

```
cd ../../..
```

Or you can enter the following shortcut to return to the previous directory, which should be the root if following
these instructions:

```
cd -
```

#### 2.1. Building and Executing a JAR file

To build the node with the desired profile (relating to the `application.<PROFILE>.properties` file), for example a
`local` profile, run the following:

```
./gradlew -Pprofile=local build
```

Once built, the packaged node can be run using:
```
java -jar ./build/libs/ocn-node-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Alternatively, a different profile can be selected at runtime, e.g.:
```
java -jar -Dspring.config.location=/path/to/application.prod.properties ./build/libs/ocn-node-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### 2.2. Using the Gradle Wrapper

Especially helpful for development, the node can quickly be run in one step with Gradle using the provided wrapper:

```
./gradlew -Pprofile=local bootRun
```

#### 2.3. Using Docker

A Dockerfile is provided which, once built, will run the above command in a container. Firstly, build the OCN Node with
gradle locally, then build the Docker image with a tag flag so that we can identify it later:

```
./gradlew -Pprofile=local build
docker build -t ocn-node .
```

Once built, the node can be run and accessed by exposing the application server's `8080` port within the container to 
the outside environment:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 ocn-node 
```

### 3. Operating the OCN Node

Once the node is running, test that it is working with the following request:

```
curl localhost:8080/health
```

You should see a 200 OK response.

For further usage documentation, consult the [API Documentation](https://shareandcharge.bitbucket.io).

### Generating new API documentation

Documentation is generated automatically on build. The asciidoc template can be found in 
`src/docs/asciidoc/index.adoc` and the output in `build/asciidoc/html5/index.html`.
