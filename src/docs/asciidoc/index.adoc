= Share&Charge CONNECT Documentation

The following documentation provides usage details, with examples, for administrators and clients of
the Share&Charge CONNECT Message Broker.


== Health

The health endpoint can be used to ensure that the message broker is reachable via HTTP.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/health/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/health/http-response.adoc[]


== Admin

The admin API allows administrators to manage their message broker. This can be used to generate new OCPI
registration tokens for parties.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/admin/http-request.adoc[]

The Authorization header should be set in the format `Token ${api_key}`. The admin can find this in stdout when
the application runs (a new key will be generated each time).

==== Body

include::{snippets}/admin/request-body.adoc[]

The request body is a list of an organization's party information, in the form of a map including their `party_id`
and `country_code`. This allows an organization with multiple OCPI parties (i.e. MSP and CPO) to register on the
same OCPI connection.

=== Response

include::{snippets}/admin/http-response.adoc[]

The response contains the OCPI `TOKEN_A` and the message broker's versions endpoint, both of which are needed to
start the registration process.


== Registry

//TODO

*TODO*

The registry API enables parties to interact with the Share&Charge registry smart contracts. This is a necessary
step in order to be able to be found by other participating parties in the network.


== Open Charge Point Interface

The Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) enables eMobility parties to connect to one another. The message broker
uses this as it's primary means of connecting such parties. It is important to have developed an OCPI version 2.2
API beforehand, in order to connect to and use a message broker. Documentation for version 2.2 can be found on
https://github.com/ocpi/ocpi/tree/develop[OCPI @ *GitHub*].
